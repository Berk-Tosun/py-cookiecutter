## Quickstart

### First Installation

You need to do this step only once
per machine. Afterwards, just use `cookiecutter` for new projects as explained
in the next section.

Before we start, make sure `pip` is up-to-date:
```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

First, install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```shell
python -m pip install pipx
```

Globally install cookiecutter:

```shell
pipx install cookiecutter
```

---

### Regular Use: Create A New Project

Now that required CLI packages are installed, you can create as many projects as you like.

1. Generate a new Python project:

    ```shell
    cookiecutter create https://github.com/Berk-Tosun/py-cookiecutter
    ```

0. Now the project is created and git is initialized for version control.
Keep using git, each commit will trigger pre-commit
and code quality will be enforced.

0. See `/path/to/new_project/CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to continue as a developer.

##  Features

* [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage dependencies.
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing.
* [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to enforce
automation on client side.
* [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) official python static type checker.
* [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for code quality + `black` code style.
* [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) for
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
* [MySt](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser) for docs.
Markdown supercharged with reStructuredText, runs with Python's Sphinx.

* `pyproject.toml` for project information.

* `requirements.txt` for complete dependency list (all dependencies are pinned:
builds are predictable and deterministic).

## Reasoning

* `pip-tools`: Python dependency management and packaging is still maturing,
there is no established standard and dominant package as of 2023. Existing packages
cover %95 of the use cases and you need to do magic on your own for remaning %5.
Thus, to keep things straightforward use pip-tools until everyone agrees on a
standard. pip-tools is very minimal and well-maintained.
[Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) is the
best future candidate and I encourage to
use it as the all-in-one Python project manager as the second alternative.
Hatch is maintained by pypa and plays nicely with standards
as it strictly follows PEPs, unlike for example, Poetry. Furthermore, Hatch is
modular,
with [little lock-in](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/meta/faq/#interoperability).

* `pytest`: Established itself as the standard testing package.

* `pre-commit`: Popular solution for maintaining quality.

* `MySt`: Consistiently maintained over quite sometime and mature. It is
popular with many projects.

    * `Markdown(.md)`: Easy to get in for new comers.

    * `reStructedText(.rst)`: Powerful, when required. Also plays nicely with
    docstrings.

    * `Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb)`: directly supported,
    good for us since we do computational programming commonly as well.

* `ruff`: Combines all standard linters with speed. Quickly became
a standard.

* `commitizen`: Proper commit messages -> promotes better commits. In addition,
allows easy semantic versioning (bump2version is included). Furthermore, autogenerated
changelogs.

* `pyproject.toml`: Official standard with good support. - no setup.py,
keep all info in one place.

* `requirements.txt`: Established and compatible with everything
(pip, CI/CD, etc.). Autogenerated with the help of pre-commit and pip-tools.
